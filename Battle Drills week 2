FOR CAMP HITTERS: Use a team of 3 to hit. You typically want 1 DPS, 1 support and 1 tank. 
Use your best heroes, levels do not matter only ascension. Try to aim for a formation that can finish the fight before 60 seconds as then you save stamina and will be able to hit more. Do not fight the boss or tower. 

Recommended teams: Team 1 = Parisa, Lyca, Eironn 
                                     Team 2 = Viperian, Carolina, Florabelle 
                                     Team 3 = Temesia, Cassadee, Arden 
                                     Team 4 = Cecia, Shakir, Rhys 
                                     Team 5 = Mirael, Rowan, Scarlita 

Alternative hero choice: Thoran, Igor, Bryon, Smokey, Odie, Marilee, Damian, Korin, Seth, Vala, Kruger

FOR BOSS/TOWER HITTERS: Save a team for the boss and 2 teams for tower. Do not clear passages, save your stamina for only the boss and tower. 

Recommended teams: Boss = Reinier (M+), Marilee (M+), Odie, Smokey, Kruger  
                                     Tower1 = Scarlita, Cassidee, Temesia, Rhys, Korin 
                                     Tower2 = Rowan, Eironn, Carolina, Arden, Damian 

Alternative hero choice: Vala, Bryon
